nslogger-examples
=================

This repository contains examples of use for [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger), with test projects that demo the logging functionality you can use in your applications.

The [NSLogger API](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger/wiki/) for client applications is fully documented in the [NSLogger wiki](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger/wiki).

iOS and Mac OS X projects use [CocoaPods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods) to embed the NSLogger client code.
